# Chirpy Starter

[![Gem Version](https://img.shields.io/gem/v/jekyll-theme-chirpy)][gem]&nbsp;

A minimal, ready-to-use template for creating a blog with the [**Chirpy**][chirpy] Jekyll theme. Get up and running in minutes with all critical files pre-configured.

## Why This Starter Exists

When installing Chirpy through [RubyGems.org][gem], Jekyll can only read a subset of theme files (`_data`, `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass`, `assets`) and limited `_config.yml` options from the gem. As a result, users cannot enjoy the full out-of-the-box experience that Chirpy offers.

To unlock all features, the following files must be present in your Jekyll site:

```shell
.
├── _config.yml
├── _plugins
├── _tabs
└── index.html
```

This starter bundles those files from the latest **Chirpy** release along with a [CD][CD] workflow, so you can start writing immediately.

## Usage

Check out the [theme's docs](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/wiki).

## Shopify Blog Migration

The one-off Shopify-to-Jekyll migration script lives at `tools/shopify_to_jekyll.py`.
It is read-only for Shopify blog content. The only POST it can send to Shopify is
the optional OAuth client credentials token exchange at `/admin/oauth/access_token`.

Install the Python dependencies in a local environment:

```shell
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

Use an existing Admin API access token:

```shell
export SHOPIFY_SHOP="openscan.myshopify.com"
export SHOPIFY_ADMIN_TOKEN="..."
python3 tools/shopify_to_jekyll.py --dry-run
```

Or use the Shopify Dev Dashboard client credentials flow:

```shell
export SHOPIFY_SHOP="openscan"
export SHOPIFY_CLIENT_ID="..."
export SHOPIFY_CLIENT_SECRET="..."
python3 tools/shopify_to_jekyll.py --dry-run
```

Optional variables:

```shell
export SHOPIFY_API_VERSION="2026-01"
export OUTPUT_DIR="/path/to/jekyll/repo"
```

Unpublished Shopify articles are fetched by default and written to `_drafts/`.
Use `--no-export-drafts` when you want to skip them. Shopify `summary_html` is
exported as front matter: `description` contains a plain-text excerpt, and
`shopify_summary_html` keeps the original HTML.

## Cleaning Migrated Shopify Posts

After migration, clean noisy Shopify/editor markup with:

```shell
git checkout -b chore/clean-migrated-posts
python tools/clean_migrated_posts.py --dry-run
python tools/clean_migrated_posts.py --write --backup
git diff
docker compose up --build
git add _posts _drafts tools/clean_migrated_posts.py
git commit -m "chore: clean migrated Shopify post markup"
```

The cleaner preserves YAML front matter, protects Liquid and code blocks, and
keeps complex HTML such as iframes, figures, video, audio, and tables as HTML.

## Local development with Docker

Build and start the local preview:

```shell
docker compose up --build
```

The site is available at <http://localhost:4000>. Jekyll runs inside the container with LiveReload enabled and uses a Docker volume for the Bundler gem cache.

Stop the local environment:

```shell
docker compose down
```

Generated local files such as `_site`, `.jekyll-cache`, `.sass-cache`, `vendor/bundle`, `vendor/cache`, and `node_modules` should not be committed.
